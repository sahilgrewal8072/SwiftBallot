It operates in a manner similar to the traditional manual voting process, requiring the input of positions, candidates, and voters into the system. This E-voting platform offers the advantage of expediting the voting process for an organization or school by providing voters with an online voting platform, with the added benefit of automatic vote counting for each candidate. The system offers a dual user interface, catering to administrators and voters. Administrators are responsible for inputting and managing system data, while voters utilize the platform to select their preferred candidates and submit their votes.
